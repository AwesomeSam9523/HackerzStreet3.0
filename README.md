# HackerzStreet 3.0
This is a [Vite](https://vite.dev/) project bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Open http://localhost:5173 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the app by modifying src/App.jsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses Vite’s fast build system and supports modern ES modules for optimized performance.
